 * @param {Response} res - The `res` parameter is an object representing the HTTP response that will be
 * sent back to the client. It is used to set the status code and send the response body.
 * @returns If there are no errors, nothing is being returned. If there are errors, a response with
 * status code 400 and a JSON object containing the properties "success" set to false and "errors" set
 * to the array of errors is being returned.
